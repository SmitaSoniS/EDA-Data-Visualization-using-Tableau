# EDA-on-NEVER-MARRIED-ON-THE-RISE-dataset
The analysis and visualization on this dataset are performed using data visualization tool Tableau.

This dataset is based on 2006-2016 survey. The people of different age groups and genders participated in this. According to my analysis on this dataset percentage of people delaying marriage is rising irrespective of age and gender. The rate at which adults choosing not marry rose higher for men than women but it would be interesting note that the percentage rise in women delaying their marriage in the age range 25-29 is higher than men within that same age range.
